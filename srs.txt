1. Frontend is React
2. Backend is FastAPI
3. There'd be 2 user privileges, admin (me/app developer) and normal user (client/corporation owner).
4. After normal user logs in, 
	if there are transport jobs, then there'd be a list of jobs with data like:
		* when was it carried?
		* which vehicle was used?
		* who was the driver?
		* international/domestic? 
		* from and to which places?
		* an option to add further jobs.
 
	else display option to add first transport job with data like:
		* scheduled Date
		* Vehicle type (mini truck/trailer-truck/train/plane/ship)
		* assigned driver
		* transport mode (international/domestic)
		* source - destination
	
	data could be modified and/or deleted by normal user.

so its simple CRUD operation app like every web app on the internet.

features in Wishlist:
	* add timer in starting of job and finishing the job. because in real time it'd be one of the main 	  features. but considering this is a personal project, timer would suffice to just finish the job 	  after a day automatically.
